<h2>IQ</h2>
The character is a little slow and has trouble learning. The level of comprehension is roughly equal to a 12-15 year old. <u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Reduce the number of <i>O.C.C Related Skills</i> by half, but add 1D4 skills to his initial set of Secondary Skills. This character still gets full benefit of skill bonuses, but probably doesn't care much for book learning or complex skills that require a lot of studying and details to remember. If that is the case, the character is likely to lean toward skills that rely on his hands and a strong back, including Domestic, Horsemanship, Mechanics, Physical, W.P.s, Wilderness and basic skills like Radio: Basic, Automotive Me­chanics, Aircraft Mechanics, Basic Electronics, First Aid, General Repair, Pilot Truck, Pilot Hover Vehicle, Pick Pockets, Palming, etc. On the other hand, the character may choose to work hard to master one more complex and difficult skills in an effort to overcome his short­ falls. Natural talent is another explanation why this character may have one or more skills that would otherwise seem beyond his limited men­tal capabilities.

<h2>IQ</h2>
The character is slow, dim-witted, and probably rather child-like. His level of comprehension is roughly equal to an 8-10 year old child. <u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Reduce the number of <i>O.C.C Skills</i> by four and reduce the number of <i>O.C.C. Related Skills</i> by half. Also reduce <i>all skill bonuses by half</i>. However, add 1D4+2 <i>Secondary Skills</i> to start. If the character can read or write, it is at a second or third grade level and complex skills are impossible to learn (i.e., could learn Basic Mechanics or Automotive Mechanics, but cannot learn Lock­ smith or Mechanical Engineer or even Aircraft Mechanics). The char­ acter is likely to lean toward simple skills, including Domestic, Horse­ manship, Physical, W.P.s, and Wilderness, and avoid skills that require a lot of practice, study and details. May be sensitive about people who make fun of him or may be totally oblivious to them.

<h2>IQ</h2>
The character has a feeble mind with a level of comprehension on par with a four or five year old child. <u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Reduce the number of <i>O.C.C Skills</i> by half(!) and the number of <i>O.C.C Related Skills</i> to a total of 1D4 with no additional skills with level advance­ment. Only O.C.C. Skills get a bonus, reduced by half; <i>O.C.C. Related Skills</i> get no bonus. Add 1D4 <i>Secondary Skills</i> to start, +l one new Secondary Skill at levels 3, 6, 10, and 15 (ignore whatever the O.C.C. description usually allows). The character cannot learn to read or write and it is impossible for him to learn anything but the most rudimentary of skills, mainly W.P.s, Domestic, Physical and Wilderness skills. May be sensitive about people who make fun of him or may be totally obliv­ious to it. Relates best to children.

   <div id='IQ_1or2' style="display: none;">
<h2>IQ</h2>  
The character has a mind on par with a two year old child. <u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Can select only 1D4+1 O.C.C. Skills, <i>no</i> O.C.C. Re­lated skills, and only gets a total of 1D4 <i>Secondary Skills</i> with no addi­tional skills gained through experience. None of the skills get any bonuses either, in fact, reduce the <i>Base Skill</i> proficiency and level advancement by half, and round down. That means if the <i>Base Skill</i> nor­mally starts at 30% +5% per level of experience, this feeble character's skill starts at 15% +2% (rounded down) per level of experience. This character barely remembers his name, can only learn the simplest of skills (G.M.'s discretion) at a substandard level, and pretty much needs to be told what to do and led by the hand. Monster races and barbarians put such characters on a leash and treat them like animals.

   <div id='ME_1or7' style="display: none;">
<h2>ME</h2>
The character is weak willed, fright­ened, and possibly an outright coward. Easily intimidated and tricked by others, and is susceptible to mind control and possession.

   <div id='MA_1or7' style="display: none;">
<h2>MA</h2>
This character has no charm or spark to his per­sonality to make a favorable impression; not very memorable or any impression made is a negative one (loser, strange, jerk). Nobody is im­pressed by this character and any moment he might have in the lime­ light passes quickly and is probably forgotten or overshadowed by something negative or someone else. He is always one of the last to be chosen for anything and is frequently snubbed.
   </div>
   
   <div id='MA_5or7' style="display: none; text-indent: 30px;">
The character is so ordinary that he is barely no­ticed or remembered, is usually ignored and picked last for everything. <u>Penalties</u>: -10% to Barter, Find Contraband, Intelligence, Performance, Public Speaking, Seduction, and Sing, and -20% on Interrogation. <u>Bo­nuses</u>: +5% on Gambling, Prowl, Undercover Ops, and Surveillance (tends not to be noticed or remembered).
   </div>
   
   <div id='MA_3or4' style="display: none; text-indent: 30px;">
The character is treated like a loser and undesirable. The things he says and does are always taken the wrong way, he can't tell a joke and may be something of a grumpy complainer or curmud­geon. That makes the character more memorable, but not in a good way, and people try to avoid and ditch him. <u>Penalties</u>: -20% to Barter, Disguise, Find Contraband, Intelligence, Performance, Public Speaking, and Sing, -30% on Interrogation and Seduction.
   </div>   
   
   <div id='MA_1or2' style="display: none; text-indent: 30px;">
This character has the personality of a rock (bland, bland, bland) or a belligerent warthog. The things he says and does are always taken the wrong way, he can't tell a joke and is either snide to and critical of others, or a grouch who has nothing nice to say about anything or anyone. That makes the character more memorable, but not in a good way, and people try to avoid and ditch him, and/or target him for pranks and trouble. <u>Penalties</u>: In addition to the obvious, -20% to Disguise if he stays quiet and doesn't make a spectacle of himself (oth­erwise his unpleasant or odd personalty leaks through), -50% to Barter, Find Contraband, Intelligence, Interrogation, Performance, Public Speaking, Seduction, and Sing.
