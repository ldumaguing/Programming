<h2>IQ</h2>
The character is a little slow and has trouble learning. The level of comprehension is roughly
equal to a 12-15 year old. <u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Reduce the number of
<i>O.C.C Related Skills</i> by half, but add 1D4 skills to his initial set of
Secondary Skills. This character still gets full benefit of skill bonuses,
but probably doesn't care much for book learning or complex skills that
require a lot of studying and details to remember. If that is the case, the
character is likely to lean toward skills that rely on his hands and a
strong back, including Domestic, Horsemanship, Mechanics, Physical,
W.P.s, Wilderness and basic skills like Radio: Basic, Automotive Me­chanics,
Aircraft Mechanics, Basic Electronics, First Aid, General Repair, Pilot Truck,
Pilot Hover Vehicle, Pick Pockets, Palming, etc. On the other hand, the character may choose
to work hard to master one
more complex and difficult skills in an effort to overcome his short­
falls. Natural talent is another explanation why this character may have
one or more skills that would otherwise seem beyond his limited men­tal capabilities.

   <div id='IQ_5or6' style="display: none;">
<h2>IQ</h2>
The character is slow, dim-witted, and probably
rather child-like. His level of comprehension is roughly equal to an
8-10 year old child. <u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Reduce the number of
<i>O.C.C Skills</i> by four and reduce the number of <i>O.C.C. Related Skills</i> by half.
Also reduce <i>all skill bonuses by half</i>. However, add 1D4+2 <i>Secondary
Skills</i> to start. If the character can read or write, it is at a second or third
grade level and complex skills are impossible to learn (i.e., could learn
Basic Mechanics or Automotive Mechanics, but cannot learn Lock­
smith or Mechanical Engineer or even Aircraft Mechanics). The char­
acter is likely to lean toward simple skills, including Domestic, Horse­
manship, Physical, W.P.s, and Wilderness, and avoid skills that require
a lot of practice, study and details. May be sensitive about people who
make fun of him or may be totally oblivious to them.

   <div id='IQ_3or4' style="display: none;">
<h2>IQ</h2>
The character has a feeble mind with a level of comprehension
on par with a four or five year old child. <u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Reduce the
number of <i>O.C.C Skills</i> by half(!) and the number of <i>O.C.C Related
Skills</i> to a total of 1D4 with no additional skills with level advance­
ment. Only O.C.C. Skills get a bonus, reduced by half; <i>O.C.C. Related
Skills</i> get no bonus. Add 1D4 <i>Secondary Skills</i> to start, +l one new
Secondary Skill at levels 3, 6, 10, and 15 (ignore whatever the O.C.C.
description usually allows). The character cannot learn to read or write
and it is impossible for him to learn anything but the most rudimentary
of skills, mainly W.P.s, Domestic, Physical and Wilderness skills. May
be sensitive about people who make fun of him or may be totally obliv­ious
to it. Relates best to children.

   <div id='IQ_1or2' style="display: none;">
<h2>IQ</h2>  
The character has a mind on par with a two year o l d child.
<u>Skill Modifiers</u>: Can select only 1D4+1 O.C.C. Skills, <i>no</i> O.C.C.
Re­lated skills, and only gets a total of 1D4 <i>Secondary Skills</i> with no
addi­tional skills gained through experience. None of the skills get any
bonuses either, in fact, reduce the <i>Base Skill</i> proficiency and level advancement
by half, and round down. That means if the <i>Base Skill</i> nor­mally
starts at 30% +5% per level of experience, this feeble character's
skill starts at 15% +2% (rounded down) per level o f experience. This
character barely remembers his name, can only learn the simplest of
skills (G.M.'s discretion) at a substandard level, and pretty much needs
to be told what to do and led by the hand. Monster races and barbarians
put such characters on a leash and treat them like animals.

   <div id='MA_1or7' style="display: none;">
<h2>MA</h2>
This character has no charm or spark to his per­sonality to make a
favorable impression; not very memorable or any
impression made is a negative one (loser, strange, jerk). Nobody is
im­pressed by this character and any moment he might have in the lime­
light passes quickly and is probably forgotten or overshadowed by
something negative or someone else. He is always one of the last to be
chosen for anything and is frequently snubbed.
   </div>
   
   <div id='MA_5or7' style="display: none; text-indent: 30px;">
The character is so ordinary that he is barely no­ticed or remembered,
is usually ignored and picked last for everything.
<u>Penalties</u>: -10% to Barter, Find Contraband, Intelligence, Performance,
Public Speaking, Seduction, and Sing, and -20% on Interrogation. <u>Bo­nuses</u>:
+5% on Gambling, Prowl, Undercover Ops, and Surveillance
(tends not to be noticed or remembered).
   </div>
   
   <div id='MA_3or4' style="display: none; text-indent: 30px;">
The character is treated like a loser and undesirable.
The things he says and does are always taken the wrong way, he can't
tell a joke and may be something of a grumpy complainer or curmud­geon.
That makes the character more memorable, but not in a good
way, and people try to avoid and ditch him. <u>Penalties</u>: -20% to Barter,
Disguise, Find Contraband, Intelligence, Performance, Public
Speaking, and Sing, -30% on Interrogation and Seduction.
