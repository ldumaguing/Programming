<b><h1>Adityan</h1></b><p>Their history is profoundly connected to humanity's past. If you are using the <b><i>Wretched Bastards</i></b> campaign setting, they were the creators of the Human race.
<p>
<b><h1>Android</h1></b><p>These characters originated from diverse ways: Some were assembled, others cultured in laboratories, or forged through sophisticated blends of synthetic and organic elements.<p>There are various types of androids and bioroids, each with its unique features and specialised functions.
<p>
<b><h1>Bioroid</h1></b><p>These characters originated from diverse ways: Some were assembled, others cultured in laboratories, or forged through sophisticated blends of synthetic and organic elements.<p>There are various types of androids and bioroids, each with its unique features and specialised functions.
<p>
<b><h1>Children of the Night</h1></b><p>The Children of the Night are bizarre creatures living in underground cities or far enough from inhabited places to keep their existence hidden.<p>Their origins are still unknown, though they are believed to be hybrids, the result of humans mating with denizens of the Beyond. Children of the Night, are mutants and will acquire changes as they advance in level. See the mutation tables below.
<p>
<b><h1>Clone</h1></b><p>These characters originated from diverse ways: Some were assembled, others cultured in laboratories, or forged through sophisticated blends of synthetic and organic elements.<p>There are various types of androids and bioroids, each with its unique features and specialised functions.
<p>
<b><h1>Deva</h1></b><p>The Deva go by many names (Angels, Amesha Spenta, Ahura, Seraphim, Sabahot, Apsara; the Deva, in Vedic religion, are an acting power that manifests itself in natural and mental phenomena).<p>However, Deva, just like the other designations, are just labels given to these creatures by mortals, that have no relation to their true origin. The truth is Deva are minor entities from the Beyond. They are physical beings, seemingly human, with high charisma and handsome looks. Just like any denizen of the Beyond, they are not inherently good or evil.
<p>
<b><h1>Dolphar</h1></b><p>The mysterious Dolphar alien race comes from an unknown planet. The Dolphar are always equipped with humanoid bodysuits, each with its own particular characteristics. For more information, see Wretched Space.
<p>
<b><h1>Dwarf</h1></b><p>Dwarves, like elves, are native to Antillia*. They are shorter than humans and elves, measuring around 1,20 meters, but also stocky, weighing 70 kg on average.<p>The males usually wear full, long beards, while females are less hirsute and wear their bears trimmed.
<p>
<b><h1>Elf</h1></b><p>Elves are dainty and slender and have pointy ears. They are shorter than humans, about 1,50 meters, and weigh around 50 to 60 kg.<p>Unlike humans, Elvenkind already existed when the Adityan arrived (elves call the aliens the “Foreign Ones”). The elves can use magical spells without going insane, as happens with the aliens and their spawn, the humans.
<p>
<b><h1>Gnome</h1></b><p>Gnomes are humanoids and distant relatives to dwarfs. Their origin is lost in time, but it is believed both races evolved from a common ancestor. Gnomes are slightly smaller than dwarves (they stand about 1 meter to 1,20 meter tall) and weigh around 50/ 60 kg. Like dwarves, gnomes live in underground cities and they are also miners and constructors. Unlike their dwarf relatives, gnomes excel at creating machinery not buildings.
<p>
<b><h1>Gustora</h1></b><p>Gustora are a race of small humanoids; their average height is between 1,20m and 1,40m. Their spiky tails and elaborate facial tattoos give them an excellent natural camouflage. The Gustora revere nature and are loyal by nature.
<p>
<b><h1>Half-Elf</h1></b><p>Half-elves can be just as petite as a regular elf, but most of them are slightly taller (around 1,60m) and heavier (from 60 to 70 kg). They are also less delicate than full elves, as their facial features appear mixed with their human side.
<p>
<b><h1>Half-Orc</h1></b><p>The only recurrent way a human female conceives a half-breed orc is by being raped, but most would rather die than give birth to a monstrosity. Female orcs will breed with humans and, some keep their progeny.
<p>
<b><h1>Human</h1></b><p>The default - and perhaps the only playable race - depending on each Game Master's choice. Human character's advantage in fantasy or science-fiction games is they are the most versatile of all races, having four free starting extra skill points (this bonus is only available if other races are also playable and if the GM allows it), which can be anything in the Skill List, and no racial requirements or penalties. Humans are typically the dominant species in <b><i>Wretched</i></b> settings.
<p>
<b><h1>Incubus</h1></b><p>An Incubus is a malevolent demon from mythological lore who takes the form of a man.<p>Most commonly associated with lustful behaviour, incubi and succubae represent evil spirits who prey upon sleeping humans.<p>However, the myths about their demonic origin are false: The truth is that they were once humans, victimized by Apostles of Pain and transformed by them.
<p>
<b><h1>Jegarni</h1></b><p>Jegarni are tall (1.80m - 2.10m), bipedal reptilian humanoids with snake-like heads. They have natural empathy with machines, and are renowned for their knowledge in navigation and mechanics.
<p>
<b><h1>Klarish</h1></b><p>The Klarish are an aggressive race of tough green-skinned beings, averaging on 1.80m height. The Klarish are strong, hardy, thick skinned and have massive square-jawed heads.
<p>
<b><h1>Loup-Garou</h1></b><p>The lycanthrope, known in French as loup-garou, is a legendary creature from European folklore, a human who has the ability to transform, partially or completely, into a wolf, or a wolf-like anthropomorphic beast.<p>This transformation can be due to several causes, such as a curse, a voluntary ritual, or a bite/scratch wound by another werewolf.
<p>
<b><h1>Mutants</h1></b><p>In the dark corners of Avalidad's underworld, far from the polished surfaces of corporate boardrooms and beyond the grasp of ZoneSec, live the forsaken outcomes of human curiosity. These are not the result of supernatural influence but of human tinkering—biotechnological errors and unregulated experiments that have bred beings both pitiful and dangerous.<p>Born from the failures of corporate research and countless black labs, their origins are rooted in experiments gone awry. Some are mutated humans, results of botched gene therapies or failed implants; others are cross-breeds, genetic cocktails of human DNA and other species. They are the skeletons in the closet for both the legal and illegal sectors of biotechnological research.<p>Life for these mutants is a subterranean existence in the literal sense. Many find shelter in the labyrinthine depths of the Underworld, where they've formed clans based on shared mutations or sheer circumstance. Each clan has its own unique identity, bound together by what's left of their human instincts. These communities engage in cryptic rituals, pledging their loyalties to the Machinatores and participating in disturbing mating customs. Yet among the grotesque rites and twisted flesh, there are glimpses of the mundane—a marketplace, for instance, where mutants and humans interact, if only briefly.<p>Among the mutants, there's a wide spectrum of cognitive function. Some are intellectually crippled, barely more than animals, while others retain or even exceed human intelligence. The latter, often mentally unhinged, have formed a belief system, a proto-religion that involves the worship of Machinatores. These underground deities offer gifts of archaic technology, deepening the mutants' attachment to their distorted faiths. Even within this umbrella of "mutants," there are subcategories. Take the Gill People—amphibious humanoids descended from '80s experiments mixing human DNA with amphibian genes. They're a commodity for those seeking longevity, as they produce a substance that significantly slows down ageing.<p>The mutants of Avalidad are a motley crew of misfits, born from the reckless pursuit of science unbound by ethics. They're not evil by default but are shaped by the harsh circumstances and public disdain they experience. In a city with its own fair share of oddities and horrors, the mutants occupy a unique niche—a reminder of what happens when human ambition overshadows human responsibility.<p><b>Note:</b><p>Though this description is centred on Avalidad (the main location of <b><i>Wretched New Flesh</i></b>), there are mutated creatures in other countries as well. The main difference is the kind of extreme experiments that develop mutants are still new outside Avalidad. Mutants can also played in other settings, such as <b><i>Wretched Apocalypse</i></b> and <b><i>Wretched Space</i></b>.
<p>
<b><h1>Pherat</h1></b><p>The Pherat are humanoid, but have concealed leathery wings capable of flight; they also have claws and talons. They possess the average human shape and form, with a thick hide that varies from orange to red or purple in colour.
<p>
<b><h1>Seraphani</h1></b><p>Seraphani are a race of bipedal canine humanoids with thick hides. Their average height is about 1.70m-1.90m.
<p>
<b><h1>Succubus</h1></b><p>A Succubus is a malevolent demon from mythological lore who takes the form of a woman.<p>Most commonly associated with lustful behaviour, incubi and succubae represent evil spirits who prey upon sleeping humans.<p>However, the myths about their demonic origin are false: The truth is that they were once humans, victimized by Apostles of Pain and transformed by them.
<p>
<b><h1>Tzangi</h1></b><p>An alien race of quadrupeds with humanoid torso, they are able to phase in and out of their natural form into a bipedal alternative shape. The Tzangi are highly intelligent and gifted in magic, but can be very reclusive due to their wariness towards other species.
<p>
<b><h1>Wampyr</h1></b><p>The Wampyr are solitary hunters who fiercely protect their territories. However, they may also form covenants for mutual protection, particularly in environments where they are not the dominant predator.<p>In cosmopolitan cities such as London, New York, Berlin and Paris, large numbers of Wampyr are attracted due to the abundance of prey and the anonymity provided by the bustling crowds. Consequently, they are forced to live in more extensive covenants, which require a more organized social structure for their survival.<p>Living in large groups also means that Wampyr must establish a hierarchy to maintain order and allocate resources efficiently.
